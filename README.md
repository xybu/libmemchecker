libmemchecker
=============

This repository saves a few libraries (or sets of functions) that can be used to generate logs for DMA function calls (malloc/calloc/realloc/free), thereby analyzing memory leak or other information.

All are written in C with supplement components written in Python or directly from GNU/Linux.
